# Hypothesis tests

# One-sample t

A one-sample t test answers these questions:

1. Is the average of a sample different from a specified value?
2. Is the average of a sample less than a specified value?
3. Is the average of a sample greater than a specified value?
4. What is the range of values that is likely to include the population average?

Four analyses are presented:

1. assumptions are validated
2. t critical vs t calculated
3. confidence interval
4. power of the test

# Two-sample t

A two-sample t test answers these questions:

1. Is the average of a sample from process 1 different from the average of a sample from process 2?
2. Is the average of a sample from process 1 greater than the average of a sample from process 2?
3. Is the average of a sample from process 1 less than the average of a sample from process 2?
4. Is the average of a sample from process 1 different from the average of a sample from process 2 by a predetermined amount?

Four analyses are presented:

1. assumptions are validated
2. t critical vs t calculated
3. confidence interval
4. power of the test

# Paired t

A paired t test answers these questions:

1. The population average of the differences ( 𝜇𝑑 ) does not equal zero.
2. The population average of the differences ( 𝜇𝑑 ) is less than zero.
3. The population average of the differences ( 𝜇𝑑 ) is greater than zero.
4. The population average of the differences ( 𝜇𝑑 ) does not some hypothesized value.
5. The population average of the differences ( 𝜇𝑑 ) is less than some hypothesized value.
6. The population average of the differences ( 𝜇𝑑 ) is greater than some hypothesized value.
7. What is the range of values that is likely to include the average of the differences?

Four analyses are presented:

1. assumptions are validated
2. t critical vs t calculated
3. confidence interval
4. power of the test
